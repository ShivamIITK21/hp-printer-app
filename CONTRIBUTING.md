Contributing to `hp-printer-app`
================================

I'm happy to accept changes into `hp-printer-app`.  For new drivers, I ask that
contributors provide me with a printer and supplies that would allow me to
debug any issues *and/or* commit to providing assistance on any issues that
are reported on Github.

Contributions should be submitted as pull requests on the
[hp-printer-app Github project](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/hp-printer-app).
New code MUST be supplied under the existing `hp-printer-app` license
(Apache 2.0).
